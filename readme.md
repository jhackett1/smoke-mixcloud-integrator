Smoke Mixcloud Integrator
=========================

Wordpress plugin implementing a simple AngularJS application to display podcasts and allow them to be played in an embedded player.

The plugin uses the Mixcloud API to list shows published by a given account, and makes a second call to retrieve the embed player HTML for a particular podcast when the user tries to play one.
